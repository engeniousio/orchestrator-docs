import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

SIFT is an open-source project that enables [iOS / Android](/platforms) developers and tester to run Unit and UI [Tests](/tests) in parallel at the speed of light. Depending on your business needs, you may scale your execution through physical Mac [nodes](/nodes) while running Unit/UI Tests on multiple [simulators](/udid#simulator). It also supports real [devices](/udid#device) for tests sharding, not to mention aggregated [test results](/test-result).
